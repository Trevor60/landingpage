              Last year was a normal year, most people had a permanent job,
              worked “9-to-5”, came home, paid the bills and were happy if
              something was left over. Many dreamed of an independent life,
              independent of location and in a modern way, but never put it into
              practice.
            </p>
            <h2>But what is happening at the moment?</h2>
            <div className="divider"></div>
            <p>
              The current situation shows us that the system that we are taught
              from an early age has its limits, we are forced to either endure
              and persevere or finally to exhaust the possibilities that our
              time gives us, believe it or not, there are more than enough
              people who still make their money, the easiest way regardless of
              covid-19.

            Well, I won't lie here. It’s a long way ahead of you which will take
            a lot of dedication and discipline, sadly there is no
            “you-will-get-rich-overnight”-scheme, so plan in your time to build
            things up, but what I can tell you: It’s worth it. I am a 30 years
            old german, earning exclusively online, and were able to move to the
            philippines. So if you want to live independently, or simply just a
            little money from the side, drop your email here and I can show you
            step-by-step how you can achieve this too.

            <p>
              I will try to keep it simple, you can imagine a Blockchain as a
              decentralized database. But the difference between a classical
              database is that data, once put into a Blockchain, can NOT be
              changed anymore. We call this immutable.
              <br />
              <br />
              This way of handling data, transactions or apps builds a trustless
              environment which is governed by a smart contract which can never
              be changed or disappear. And everybody who wants to deal with a
              smart contract can read it first, before any interaction because
              it's public. So if you use these contracts to start a business
              model, it doesn’t matter what any government says about it, they
              can not close it or interfere in it, hackers can not steal your
              data and personal information AND you can read the contract in the
              very start to verify that nobody messes with you. Isn't this
              already awesome by itself? Being totally independent?

              <br />
              But now: Let's get started: <br />
              <br />
              Your first challenge is always to interact with a new technology
              and get some experience with it. So we will start here very simply
              by buying your first cryptocurrency and to do that you need a
              provider which sells you even that and of course I have some of
              them here for you! If you are using an android device or a PC /
              Laptop you can directly go into the next section, since Metamask
              and Trustwallet are both connected to very trustworthy payment
              providers, which make it very simple for you.
              <br />
              <br /> If you are using an iPhone / iOS device you have a little
              handicap here, but nothing to worry! You only have to make
              yourself an account at Coinbase (one of the largest Crypto
              Exchanges in the world, licensed in wastely the majority of the
              world) or crypto.com, a bank like cryptocurrency platform which
              offers huge benefits to their clients (like high interest rates on
              deposits or an own prepaid / debit Visa card with cashback system.
              Cryotp.com is licensed too in most countries of the world.) and
              buy it there. Simply follow the link below and make yourself an
              account.

              <br />
              <b>

            <p>
              This step makes sure you have a wallet with a DApp browser. This
              is important since the DApp browser gives us the possibility to
              interact with Smart Contracts in a very convenient way. I listed
              out 3 possibilities for you. <br />
              <br />
              1. Trust Wallet for Android Devices (in-App Ether purchases
              possible)
              <br /> <br />
              2. Coinbase Wallet ( not Exchange like above, this is a different
              app from the same provider) for iOS (in-App Ether purchases not
              possible)
              <br /> <br />
              3. And Metamask, my favorit, for PC and Laptop. Their mobile
              version is still a beta version and doesn’t work well for now so
              only use it if you are a PC / Laptop guy like me. (in-App Ether
              purchases possible)
              <br />
              <br />
              Depending on your device you only have to click one of the links
              and download the right app. <br />
              <br />
              <b>Important Note:</b>
              <br />
              <br /> While you are opening your account in one of these Apps it
              will ask you to store your 12 words seed phrase. Please take this
              very seriously. The crypto you load up to your wallet is stored on
              your device, so if you lose your device your money's gone and the
              only way to get it back is with that phrase. So please store it in
              a safe way, preferable on a piece of paper and NEVER share it to
              anyone.
            </p>

            <div className="divider"></div>
            <p>
              Now that you have purchased Ether and opened a wallet with a DApp
              browser you need to transfer your Ether from your exchange to your
              wallet. This works similar to a bank transfer. You have to get
              your Ether address from your wallet, go to your exchange and look
              for the option like “send ether to the external wallet”. Then
              paste in your ether address from your wallet and confirm the
              transaction. You will see here that every transaction on the
              blockchain is connected to a small fee, which we call “Gas fee”.
              Since the blockchain itself has to be mined so it is immutable
              this is something we have to accept.
              <br />
              <br /> But believe me, you won’t mind this small fee after
              following me how to earn with this awesome technology. After a few
              seconds the Ether should arrive in your wallet and you are all set
              to earn!
              <br />
              <br />

            <div className="divider"></div>
            <p>
              So now that you (hopefully) bought your first Ether and
              transferred it into your wallet with the DApp browser, we can
              start interacting with our first smart contract that can earn
              money. All you have to do is, if you are on Metamask at your
              Laptop or PC, click the nice button below. If you are not on your
              Laptop or PC you have to copy and paste this link into the DApp
              Browser of your Wallet:

              register now (same as above), after clicking this one, you will
              have to confirm the transaction of approximate 0.13 Ether (if it’s
              more I would wait a few minutes and try it again, the network fees
              vary). After approving the transaction you are done! Welcome to
